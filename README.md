A end to end project on how to implement the SARIMA method in Python using the Statsmodels library.
Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average, or ARIMA, is one of the most widely used forecasting methods for univariate time series data forecasting. Although the method can handle data with a trend, it does not support time series with a seasonal component. An extension to ARIMA that supports the direct modeling of the seasonal component of the series is called SARIMA.
